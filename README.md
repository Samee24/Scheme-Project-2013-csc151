==========================

By utilizing GIMP + Mediascript + Scheme, I (along with my partners) created a program that churns out 1000 unique images. Although these images aren't representational, their basic theme exudes a sense of depth and perception in deep space, overlaid with retro shape and line sequences - the shapes and lines utilize an accented analogic color scheme.
